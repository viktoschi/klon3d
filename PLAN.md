# Plan: fit simulator in Rust

Decision of 2026-10-18: **entirely in Rust**, without Blender at runtime.

**Status: 2026-10-31.** Stages 0 and 1 are done, stage 2 done — including the
silhouette check (finding 24, `klon3d-koerper/src/silhouette.rs`) — stage 6
partly brought forward. The body and its
67 measurements now come from the **reference** resizing folder (finding 64); the
older chain is kept as a backup for old folders and the Newton fit remains the
last fallback. In stage 3,
boundary edges and seam pairs are done (finding 32), as are the mesh and seam subdivision
(`klon3d-mesh`, finding 33); both acceptance tests on Bluse3 v2 have passed. From stage 4 on,
the solver runs on the GPU with a CPU reference as the yardstick, and motion is
a goal as stage 7 (ADR-018). In stage 4, the XPBD reference (finding 34) and
the implicit step with CG like CLO (finding 35) are done on the tube; since 2026-10-27 the
implicit step is the basis and XPBD remains a cross-check path
(ADR-020). Since 2026-10-27 the shaped body is a mesh collision body
in the solver (finding 94), and Bluse3 v2 can be placed around it and dressed
onto it (4c largely done, findings 95, 96: 98.6% of seam pairs closed); with Bluse1 v25 and the strapless bustier v1,
the same chain also dresses other patterns without per-pattern tuning, and everything holds by tension (finding 98:
99.4 / 99.1 / 94.6%). Findings 17–24 changed the foundations of stages 2
and 3 — they are incorporated below.

Since 2026-10-31 the placement puts the collar on the **slanted** neck seam
(finding 121): the seam is not a horizontal circle but runs from 1.3161 m at
the front to 1.3750 m at the back, so height and radius are taken per
circumference angle from the four neck landmarks. Before, 16 collar points sat
inside the skin, the deepest 5.68 mm below it at the back; now none do, and the
deepest sits 19.81 mm above the skin (reference folder), 21.71 mm (older
folder), in 4 of 4 cases.

## Starting point — what already exists

| Exists | Where | Meaning for this plan |
|---|---|---|
| CLO base mesh (reference folder), 47,650 vertices | `C:\Program Files\CLO Standalone OnlineAuth\Preset\Avatar\Resizing\Female\BaseMesh.obj` | cm, body 164.15 cm tall, 76,298 triangles (group `body` 62,658, model 40,465 points) - **the basis** (finding 64; the older mesh is only a backup) |
| CLO shaping data (reference folder) | there: `FeatureData.bd`, `ReducedVertexData.bd`, `PCA_weight.bd`, `..\Detail_*.txt` | finding 64: shaping matrices computed by regression at load time (PCA); specification `spez/formung_2026_1.md`. The older fields `ConvertingMat_*.bd` (finding 18) are only a backup |
| `.sm2d` calculator (Python) | `D:\ai\spacebunny\schnitt.py` | reference for the target geometry, **not** a dependency |
| Measurement file `.smis` | `Hexenensemble...\measurements.smis` | 85 measurements, 160 cm, bust 92.67, waist 74, hip 90, HighHip 83, underbust 76; reader done (finding 24) |
| 528 real `.sm2d` patterns | `latex_schnitte\` | test material, 528/528 readable |
| Formula engine (Rust) | `crates\klon3d-pattern\src\formula.rs` | part of stage 1, done |
| Circumference measurement on the mesh | `crates\klon3d-koerper\src\lib.rs` | section loop, 4 tests green |
| 2D pattern viewer | `crates\klon3d-view`, `klon3d-fenster.exe` | Win32 + GDI, PNG output — **diagnostic tool**, not stage 6 |

**No longer needed:** rebuilding the MakeHuman body. Blender is used once as a
data source (exporting the base body); after that it is out of the picture.

## Scope

**Will be built:** read pattern → 3D geometry → material → simulation → inspection output.

**For latex and fabric** (ADR-021, 2026-10-27): klon3d should also simulate garments
made of woven and knitted fabric from Seamly2D patterns, not just latex.
Latex remains the first test case; every stage is built so that fabric is not
ruled out. What fabric additionally requires is listed below in the section
"Fabric alongside latex".

**Also for CLO projects** (ADR-022, 2026-10-27): besides `.sm2d`, klon3d reads
`.zprj` — pieces, seams, fabrics, placement and avatar — so that a CLO project can be
dressed without a handwritten seam and placement file. Reading comes first;
writing back has not been decided. See the section "Reading CLO projects".

**Holding as in real life** (ADR-023, 2026-10-27): garments stay on solely through
the tension of the rubber and friction on the skin, under full gravity —
nothing is pinned. Aids during dressing are allowed if they only reproduce
the act of dressing; afterwards, a hold phase under full gravity is part of
acceptance (at least 10 s, no piece sinks more than 5 mm).

**Not built:** 2D pattern editing beyond verification purposes, layout,
grading, production-quality rendering.

---

## Stage 0 — Foundation (done)

Rust 1.99.1 (MSVC) under `tools\rust`. Workspace with `klon3d-pattern`.
Formula engine: lexer, recursive descent, QMuParser dialect, 9 tests green.

## Stage 1 — Read `.sm2d` completely

| Part | Content | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| Data model | `pattern`, `increments`, `draftBlock`, `pieces` | `male_shirt.sm2d` and `Bluse3_Plunge_Cups_parametrisch_v2.sm2d` parse |
| XML reader | quick-xml, attributes as `Option<f64>` | — |
| Point types | `single` `endLine` `alongLine` `normal` `shoulder` `height` `lineIntersectAxis` `curveIntersectAxis` `cutSpline` `modeling`; since finding 99 also `cutArc`, `pointOfIntersectionArcs`, `pointOfIntersectionCurves`, `trueDarts` | points agree with `schnitt.py` to 0.01 mm |
| Operations and sub-curves | `moving`, `rotation`, `flippingByAxis`, `flippingByLine` with point and curve copies (name + suffix); sub-curves of `cutSpline`/`cutSplinePath` and sub-arcs of `cutArc` for `Spl_`, `SplPath_`, `Arc_` | **done** (finding 99): Bolero v36/v37 and stocking v26 without errors, perimeters as in Seamly2D's own export (≤ 0.03 mm); open: sub-curves of `curveIntersectAxis`, L036 (18 measurements missing) |
| Splines and arcs | `NodeSpline`, `NodeSplinePath`, arcs | — |
| `idObject` resolution | piece nodes → outline paths | piece outlines close |
| Seam allowance | `seamAllowance` bool, `width` as a formula, `<CSA>` | width computable |

**Acceptance criterion:** the piece outlines of 10 patterns match `schnitt.py
piece_outline`.

## Stage 2 — Measurements and body

| Part | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `.smis` reader | `<m name value>`, units cm/mm/inch, `@` names, comments | **done** (`smis.rs`, 12 tests; finding 24) |
| Circumference measurement | section loop that encloses the body axis, gaps ≤ 2 cm closed like a seam | **done for the torso** (findings 22, 25) |
| Tape measure | convex hull of the section as in CLO (`massband.rs`), candidate selection for the five torso measurements, sampling | **done**: 21 of 22 reference values on the BaseMesh < 0.00001 cm, same candidates (finding 30) |
| Body base | CLO's `BaseMesh.obj`, 47,650 points, 166.62 cm | **available** |
| Shaping | `P = base mesh + F_last + Σ F_k · c_k` from the `.bd` fields | **built in**, 5 torso measurements + 8 height fields (finding 24) |
| 58 measurements | all of CLO's measuring methods (`messung.rs`) | **done**: 57 of 58 on the BaseMesh ≤ 5·10⁻⁷ cm, Wrist +0.035 mm (finding 31) |
| 67 measurements (reference set) | `messung_referenz.rs`: the measurement set of the reference folder, cut in `f32` (`massband::kantenschnitt_f32`, `normale_f32`) | **done**: 0.00020 / 0.00033 / 0.00014 mm on the three reference meshes (`messung_referenz_clo.rs`) |
| Shaping chain | BASE + DETAIL Human with calibration, symmetry, centering, `.avs`, hand correction, `.smis` mapping (`kette.rs`) | **done**: all test cases of the specification, against CLO ≤ 0.51 mm (finding 31); **wired up**: `klon3d koerper <measurements.smis> [--out]` shapes the body via `koerper.rs` (group `body` in mm with triangles, also the input for stage 4); if the chain's resizing data are missing, it falls back to `anpassen.rs` (test `koerper_weg`) |
| Reference shaping chain | `kette_referenz.rs`: the folder no longer ships the finished converting fields, so the form step is computed — PCA regression over `FeatureData` / `ReducedVertexData` / `PCA_weight`, then calibration, symmetry, centring, `.avs`, hand and head post-processing (`nacharbeit_referenz.rs`) | **done**: regression residual 4.9·10⁻⁷, final values ≤ 0.037 mm, points ≤ 0.026 mm (`formung_referenz_clo.rs`, `kette_referenz_clo.rs`) |
| Three paths | `koerper.rs` tries the reference chain (`Weg::Kette`), then the older chain for old folders (`Weg::KetteAlt`), then the Newton fit (`Weg::Anpassen`) | **done** (`koerper_weg.rs`): each path is checked from its own folder; a folder with only the old `Advanced` files still shapes |
| `.smis` path and HighHip | the reference fields do not carry HighHip, so it is derived from the chain's own BASE mesh | **done** (`kette_referenz_smis.rs`): 5 BASE and 21 DETAIL form steps, both converge, final values within 0.1 mm and points within 0.05 mm of the reference |
| Target person | `person.rs`: `.smis` → CLO fields, heights, measurement lines, active fields | **available** (finding 24) |
| Measurement lines | material lines that move with the mesh (`spur.rs`) **or** fixed sections at the `.smis` target heights | **available** (findings 23/24) |
| Reference measurements | 32 values of the `DETAIL_Advanced` stage (heights in cm, apex 119.41, waist 105.71, crotch 76.87) | **available** (finding 22) |
| Acceptance | measured circumference hits the target value | **passed with the shaping chain** (finding 31): CLO measurement bust +0.03, underbust −0.00, waist +0.02, HighHip at CLO's position −0.01, hip −0.02; sampling waist −0.89, hip −0.01. The old route via `anpassen.rs` does not reach them with the tape measure (finding 30) |
| Height frame | measurement heights from the floor: center the mesh before measuring (lowest point y = 0) | **available** in tape-measure mode; the contour route still cuts 1.95 cm too low (finding 30) |
| Silhouette | self-intersection, dents on the shaped body | **done** (`crates/klon3d-koerper/src/silhouette.rs`): contacts are classified as crossing, overlap or touch, and a crossing is judged by its penetration width, not by its existence. Against the base mesh, which already carries contacts, the reference shaping reduces crossings 464 → 54, dents 114 → 82 and the widest crossing 1.46 → 1.18 mm; no new crossing is wider than one already present, no overlap, no dent grows. Same rules hold on the older chain. Checked by `tests/silhouette_clo.rs` |

**Acceptance criterion:** circumferences on the mesh within ±1 cm of the `.smis` values
(bust 92.67 / waist 74 / hip 90 / HighHip 83 / underbust 76). That is
the criterion from the handover. Measured like a tape measure, as defined in
`spez/massdefinitionen.md`; test
`kette_clo::abnahme_aus_smis`; both numbers (CLO measurement at the candidate and
sampling) lie within ±1 cm, HighHip applies at CLO's position (finding 31).

**What findings 18/22 change:** the shaping is **linear in the coefficients**,
and the fields ship with the CLO installation. The field order is
the ID order of the measurements, the last field has the coefficient 1.0, and
`DETAIL_Advanced_TotalHeight` reproduces `BaseMesh.obj` to 0.00014 cm.
No hand-tuned deformation is needed — CLO's own fields are the
template.

**Integration (in order):**

1. Load `BaseMesh.obj` and the 33 fields of `DETAIL_Advanced_TotalHeight`
   (format: `int32 fields, int32 vectors`, then `f32` feature by feature).
2. Check the reference vector `c_ref` (32 values, finding 22) and the starting body:
   `P = G + F_last + Σ F_k c_ref` (G = base mesh) must reproduce the reference exactly.
3. Measurement operator in cm: with `.smis` heights the section is taken **at the
   target height** (bust 111 etc.), otherwise on the reference's material line
   that moves with the mesh (finding 24).
4. Jacobian of the **active fields**, numerically per round (difference step 1.0),
   damped Newton `δ = (A + λI)⁻¹(m_target − m_actual)`, step rejection like CLO's
   driver. The full 31-column solution diverged; it dragged calf, foot and
   wrist along (finding 24).
5. Acceptance: bust/underbust/waist/HighHip/hip within ±1 cm, body
   not self-intersecting. **Reached** (finding 24): 14 rounds, 1.8 s,
   error ≤ 0.006 cm. Still open: the crotch gap at 73 cm (open seam,
   stage 4). The silhouette check is done in
   `crates/klon3d-koerper/src/silhouette.rs`.

**What finding 25 changes:** the base mesh is **open at the seams**
(4,170 open edges, 366 components). The torso section is therefore usually
an open chain, not a ring. The length of the chain is already the
circumference, though; only the closing piece across a gap of 0.02–1.25 cm is missing.
`rumpf()` closes gaps up to 2 cm (finding 22) — this makes measuring possible at
every torso height. Also, the bust lies at 120 cm, not at
98 cm — the fixed heights in `abnahme.rs` are chosen wrongly.

## Stage 3 — Pattern to mesh

| Part | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Boundary edges** | seam line per piece split at the point nodes, length, notches, seam allowance per edge (`kanten.rs`) | **done** (finding 32) |
| **Seam assignment** | seam list `<pattern>.naehte` next to the pattern: sides made of whole boundary edges, 1:1 up to M:N; `klon3d naehte` checks lengths, notches, coverage (`naehte.rs`) | **done** (finding 32); **seam suggestion** `klon3d naehte --vorschlag` (finding 101): Bluse3, Bluse1, bustier and skirt edge for edge like the hand-written list, direction and mirroring from the seam graph; open: pleats (bolero), slits |
| **Triangulation** | seam line → triangle mesh per piece, approx. 10 mm edge length: boundary split by curvature, ear clipping, Lawson, Ruppert with a minimum angle of 25°, smoothing; exact on an integer grid (`klon3d-mesh`) | **done** (finding 33) |
| **Subdivision** | subdivide both seam partners equally by **length fraction** as in CLO (§4 of the specification), point nodes of both sides merged up to 2 mm; result: point pairs per sub-seam; `klon3d netz` | **done** (finding 33) |
| Seams | support springs between the partners, 6 mm overlap seam in the middle | flush seam with bending across the seam **done** (finding 34); the overlap seam comes with the glue zones |
| Reduction | scale rest lengths: torso 5.5%, sleeves 1–2%, cuff 5% | **done** (finding 34): rest length × (1 − r), mass of the cut piece × (1 − r)²; if the reduction is already in the pattern (Bluse3), r = 0 |
| **Glue zones** | areas that bond two layers firmly: laminate (the whole area of a piece), reinforcement and appliqué (internal shape), overlap seam as a glued strip. Model: CLO's *Gluing* (Glue Fill by outline, Glue Brush painted freely) | **done** as a bond that holds the offset vector (`klebung.rs`, task #11): no sliding, load carried across, `klebt <Teil>` in the placement file; **done** also the bending of the bonded pair (`Stoffpaar::biegefaktor`, task #13): a zone over the whole face bends like the laminate of the same thickness; not against the body ("Tack on Avatar") |

**Acceptance criterion:** all seam pairs of equal length, deviation ≤ 0.08 cm —
the criterion from `pruef_bluse3.py`. **Passed** (finding 32,
test `naehte::abnahme_stufe3_bluse3_v2`): 24 seam pairs, largest deviation
N07 front upper panel seam −0.0737 cm (Seamly decomposition; with the
drawn polyline −0.0758, as in `pruef_bluse3.py`).

**The seam model per CLO** (`spez/naehte_2026_1.md`):
an outline is a list of lines from segment point to segment point; a
seam side is (shape, start and end line with fraction, direction); a seam has
two sides of 1…n seam sides each. The side sums are compared
(Check Sewing Length: red from 5 mm or 10%); when sewing, equal
length fractions are matched to each other. **Notches do not occur in the seam model.**
Auto-Sewing pairs via piece types and edge types on the avatar
(finding 71).

**Older version, backup only (finding 19):** pairing via notches as `alpha`
with the thresholds 0.1 and 0.03 - no longer present in the reference
version (finding 60).

**Acceptance of mesh and subdivision** (agreed with the user on
2026-10-20, test `klon3d-mesh/tests/bluse3_v2.rs`): mesh boundary within 0.01 cm of
the boundary edge (position and length), mesh area = boundary polygon, minimum angle 25°
(except in piece corners that are themselves sharper), edges about 10 mm, every
sub-seam with the same number of boundary points in sequence on both sides, offset of merged
points ≤ 2 mm. **Passed:** 28 pieces, 6,471 points, 10,734 triangles,
smallest angle 25.1°, median of the inner edges 9.9 mm, 24 seams with 715
point pairs, largest offset 0.25 mm (N02), 34 ms. In the pattern collection (6,193 pieces)
every piece passes.

**Still missing:** seam springs on the point pairs, partial stretches of an edge
(CLO's Free Sewing), internal shapes (holes, internal lines) and
darts as seam sides, an automatic seam list as a suggestion.

**Meshes in the viewer:** `klon3d netz --svg` draws meshes and
seam points, `--obj` writes them; `klon3d-fenster` does not show them yet.

**For a 3D display of the seam** the viewer lacks the
**3D projection**. `klon3d-view` only draws 2D so far.
That is a separate step, not part of the pairing.

## Stage 4 — Solver (the core)

**Implicit step with CG like CLO** (backward Euler, preconditioned
CG, contact filter; ADR-020, 2026-10-27); **XPBD** remains as a second,
independent computation path for checks on the CPU (this supersedes ADR-009).
The solver runs on the **GPU via `wgpu` compute shaders**; the
**CPU reference** `ImplizitCg` (`f64`) with the same method is the
yardstick (ADR-018). Reason: the goal also
includes **motion** (stage 7), and that needs the computing power of the GPU.

**Steps:**

| Step | Content | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **4a Tube with XPBD (cross-check path)** | crate `klon3d-sim`, Rust `f64`, data as arrays (struct of arrays), constraints ordered by graph coloring, substeps. Distance constraints from the mesh edges (finding 33) with rest length × (1 − reduction); seam constraints from the point pairs, bending also across the seams; gravity, damping; collision against a cylinder with friction from the physical load; position, displacement and correction kept separate (for f32). Test case: rectangle sewn into a tube, around a cylinder; `klon3d roehre` | **done** (finding 34): both fabrics, 0/5.5/10%, hoop strain −0.06 pp (tolerance ±0.5), seam 0.0000 mm, lies against the cylinder, mesh resolution 0.05 pp; the slip test follows Coulomb to 0.05%. Condition: **softness condition** α/h² ≥ 9·(wᵢ+wⱼ) — tube 116–434 substeps per frame |
| **4a′ Tube, implicit with CG like CLO (CPU reference, basis)** | second computation path `ImplizitCg` in `klon3d-sim`: backward Euler, matrix-free PCG with 3×3 diagonal blocks, contact filter, normal force from the system, Coulomb friction, warm start; CLO setting of 1 step per frame, 50 CG iterations, seam spring 500 N/m | **done** (finding 35): tube, both fabrics at 5.5/10%, with the same acceptance as 4a, slip test at most 1.6% off the discrete path; frictionless, the same equilibrium as XPBD; blouse 13–137 ms per frame instead of 1.2–4 s, on the GPU around 310 instead of 140,000 dispatches per frame. Limits: a stiff seam only just converges, loose pieces come to rest poorly with 50 iterations. The basis since ADR-020 |
| **Substeps per frame** | `schritte_je_bild` in `ImplizitParameter` | **done**: default 5, matching the `Nonlinear` preset (residual 1e-5). With one substep a 5.5% Radical band on the reference body does not settle and sits 2-4% off the tape-measure circumference; the error falls monotonically with the substep count (0.06% at five) |
| **Body as collision body** (before 4c) | body from `klon3d koerper` as a mesh in `klon3d-sim` (`netzkoerper.rs`, `Koerper::Netz`): signed distance via the nearest point and angle-weighted pseudonormals, grid search (20 mm cells, 10 mm search depth), in the implicit step a penetration check along the path with Coulomb friction on the impact. Test cases: tube on a cylinder mesh, band around the waist, point rain | **done** (finding 94): tube on the mesh, ε within 0.002 pp of the analytic case, frictionless the same equilibrium, slip test −0.11/+0.41%; band (10 mm mesh) at rest in all four cases, edges against the tape measure in their plane: Retifist ≤ 0.25%, Radical ≤ 2.7%, no point inside the skin; point rain at 6 m/s 100/100 at the impact location (without the penetration check 10/100). Open: the Radical band in the 5 mm mesh folds and does not come to rest without self-collision; body vertex against cloth triangle; moving body |
| **4b GPU** | the implicit step from 4a′ as a WGSL compute shader via `wgpu`, `f32` (ADR-020): forces and 3×3 Jacobian blocks per edge, seam and bending, gathered per point via neighbor lists (no atomics); matrix-free A·p, block-Jacobi preconditioner with contact filter, dot products as reductions in a fixed order, warm start; contact, normal force and friction per point; collision and self-collision via spatial hashing. To be settled with 4b (finding 35, section 5): a better preconditioner for stiffer seams and loose pieces; whether edge springs are replaced by a triangle continuum | the same equilibrium as `ImplizitCg` on the tube and on the blouse in a standing pose (define and justify the tolerance), also at body height; slip test as in finding 35; Bluse3 v2 at ≥ 30 frames per second on the RTX 3090 (goal: 50 iterations, around 310 dispatches per frame); GPU tests skip themselves without an adapter and report it |
| **4c Placement** | place the 2D pieces around the body before sewing. CLO puts them on arrangement points on hull bodies around torso, arms and legs (finding 71, addendum); klon3d needs its own simple approach, e.g. zone and side per piece (in the seam list or a separate file) and cylinders or ellipses from the body measurements of stage 2. Then the seam constraints pull the pieces together. **Built** (`platzierung.rs`, placement file `<pattern>.lage`, `klon3d anziehen`): vertical torso prism from the convex hull of the torso points, around the arm the cross-section hull per centimeter, neck seam with height and radius per angle from the four landmarks (slanted, not a horizontal circle; finding 121); per piece: zone, reference point (also from another piece of the same block), circumferential position in degrees or cm, height at a reference height, `gespiegelt` (mirrored), `drehung` (rotation), `abstand` (offset) | all pieces of Bluse3 v2 lie around the body without penetration, the seams close. **Largely done** (findings 95, 96): 16 sewn pieces placed (12 glued-on ones are missing until glue zones exist); dressed with a limited sewing speed (0.1 m/s) and body vertex against cloth triangle during sewing, around the arm a length-preserving arm prism: no point inside the skin, every seam median < 0.8 mm, **98.6% of seam pairs ≤ 10 mm**, 18 of 24 seams fully closed (finding 95 without both: 92.4%). **Generality** (finding 98): Bluse1 v25 and bustier v1 as further test patterns, all three with the same settings — sewn while held (without gravity), cloth points pushed out of the skin beforehand, seam spring 2,000 N/m during dressing, thickness per piece (`dicke` in the placement file), then 2 s of settling and a 10 s hold phase under full gravity (ADR-023): **Bluse3 99.4%, Bluse1 99.1%, bustier 94.6%**, no piece sinks more than 0.4 mm. Finding 100: Bolero v37 96.5% (pleats as darts), skirt v36 95.1% (holds, but not fully at rest: flared panels overlap on the vertical prism); finding 101: seam list and placement **automatic** (`klon3d naehte --vorschlag`, `klon3d lage`); dressed entirely without hand-written files, all five hold (Bluse3 98.6%, Bluse1 98.0%, bustier 96.0%, bolero without sleeves 96.0%, skirt 95.7% — the skirt reacts chaotically to tenths of a millimeter in the initial placement); the placement suggestion lies 0.3–2.8 cm off the hand-made placements. Finding 102: the unrest came from truncated CG solves (50 iterations); with up to 600 iterations during dressing, a torso hull that widens under flared panels, and settling until at rest (2–20 s) before the hold phase: **Bluse3 98.9%, Bluse1 98.9%, bustier 93.6%, bolero 94.5%, skirt 99.2%** with hand-written files, all hold (±0.2 mm), the skirt is insensitive to the initial placement; computing time up to three times longer. Open: corners (sleeve hem, collar end, cup attachments), zones for legs and head, gaps in the pattern reader (`cutArc`, `pointOfIntersectionArcs`, `pointOfIntersectionCurves`, curve names with an underscore) |
| **4d Test blouse v26 standing** | the whole blouse on the shaped body from `klon3d koerper` | acceptance criterion below; in addition "holds" per ADR-023: after dressing ≥ 10 s of full gravity, no piece sinks more than 5 mm, nothing pinned |

**Status of 4b (task #27): the CG solve runs on the GPU, and it is not yet
faster.** `gpu.rs` solves `A·Δv = b` with the same matrix-free PCG in `f32`: the
operator over edges, seams and bending gathered per point over a neighbour
list, the block-Jacobi preconditioner, the contact filter, fixed-order
reductions, warm start and the same stopping rule. It runs as **one compute
shader** (one workgroup, `workgroupBarrier` between phases): a dispatch per
phase needs about 40 µs on this machine, which is already the length of a CPU
iteration, and five of them per iteration lost against the CPU before the
shader was written.

What is proven (tests, `cargo test --release -p klon3d-sim --test gpu`, all
green on the RTX 3090, and skipped without an adapter):

* `A·p` of the same system agrees with the CPU operator to **1e-4 relative**
  (constant, random and velocity vector);
* the tube with 5.5 % Radical reaches the **same equilibrium** as `ImplizitCg`
  (circumference strain within 0.02 pp, seam gap < 1 mm, radius per point
  within 0.05 mm);
* the slip test follows the discrete path within 2 %;
* without a body, both backends shrink the tube to the same minimum (largest
  point distance 1e-5 m).

What it costs and what it yields, measured on Bluse3 v2 on the CLO body

| frame, holding | 334 ms | 563 ms |
| CG iterations per solve | 122 | 135 |
| solves that did not converge | 0 of 9 792 | 1 of 9 792 |
| `ende.obj` against the CPU run | - | median 0.85 mm, mean 2.14 mm, max 22.4 mm |

The CPU run of the same command under this change is **byte-identical** to the
reference of task #25 (`E86DDF85…`): the step itself did not change, only who
solves the linear system. The GPU state is within the 2 mm noise floor of the
comparison map in the median and the mean; the tail differs, which is what the
last bits of `f32` do on a frictional garment.

So the 30 fps criterion is **not** reached, and the reason is structural: 5 538
points are too few to fill the card, and one workgroup is latency-bound at
about 0.4 ms per iteration, while the CPU needs about 0.25 ms. More parallelism
means more dispatches, and each dispatch costs more than the work. The next
step is therefore not "more GPU" but fewer iterations (a better
preconditioner, finding 35 section 5) or a different structure (multigrid,
several workgroups with one synchronisation per chunk).


Not in this slice: forces, contact distance queries, the penetration push,
friction and the release pass stay on the CPU (they are geometry queries);
springs of glue zones and self-collision go to the CPU backend and are counted
(`GpuLoeser::ausweichungen`) instead of being dropped; self-collision is not on
the GPU; nothing is claimed about bodies at height or moving bodies.

| Constant | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Distance | distance constraint, stiff for woven fabric, soft for latex |
| Bending | very low stiffness — latex barely kinks |
| Volume | for "body hug" (5% reduction) |
| Body collision | cloth vertex against body triangle, Coulomb friction, penetration check within the step (finding 94); body vertex against cloth triangle as a post-correction, during dressing while sewing (finding 96) |
| Self-collision | as in CLO (finding 116): proximity springs point-triangle and edge-edge up to r₁ + r₂ + 0.04 mm with r = (thickness + additional thickness 2.5 mm)/2, intersections resolved via intersection regions with a constant push, impulse with position correction to 0.1 mm; spatial hashing |
| Air damping | per material profile |
| Gluing | points of both layers in a glue zone rigidly coupled; the glued area bends like a plate of the total thickness |

**Latex material profile:**

| Quantity | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness | 0.4 mm (torso), 1.0 mm (cups, collar) | pattern files |
| Density | 0.95 g/cm³ → 0.38 kg/m² | assumption, to be tried out |
| Stretch | 5–10% almost linear, high elongation at break | assumption |
| Bending stiffness | very low | assumption |
| Friction | high on skin | assumption |

The handover document explicitly marks these values as **an assumption, not
confirmed**. They are among the first things to calibrate.

**Acceptance criterion:** standing, the simulation shows the five known faults
of test blouse v26 (see below).

**Gluing (the user's request, 2026-10-19):** latex is glued, not sewn. klon3d
should be able to do this itself, not via a detour through CLO. **Done** (task
#11) as glue zones: a bonded point holds its **offset vector** to a triangle of
the layer below (CLO's tack spring, finding 59), one spring per point, stiffness
from the upper fabric's in-plane value. The placement file carries it as
`klebt <Teil>`, and `klon3d anziehen` reports coupled points, the largest rest
gap and the points without a counterpart.

What that does and does not give: two bonded layers no longer slide, and a
displacement of one layer carries the other along (test `klebung`). The
comparison planned here does **not** separate the cases: on a 200 × 40 mm strip
held at both ends, two loose layers, two bonded layers and one 0.8 mm laminate
sag within 0.2 % of each other (9.254 / 9.254 / 9.235 mm), because the sag is
carried by membrane tension and `2 × 348 N/m` in parallel equals the laminate's
`696 N/m`. That test stands, with its explanation, and would fail if the strip
ever started to depend on bending.

**Bending of the bonded pair** (task #13): the bond is a shear spring and
cannot make a plate, so the zone carries a bending term of its own. Every
bending constraint whose two triangles lie **inside** the bonded area has its
compliance divided by the pair's factor, derived from the common neutral axis
(`Stoffpaar::biegefaktor`, `4` for two equal layers). That reproduces the
`Latex_Laminat_2x0.4mm` row of `MATERIAL.md` exactly — measured on a strip bent
onto a circular arc (no membrane strain), the bonded pair carries `0.0178 µJ`
against the laminate's `0.0178 µJ`, and `4.0000×` two loose layers
(`0.0044 µJ`). The factor stays inside the zone: a patch covering half a piece
stiffens that half plus one mesh element of border, never the rest.
`Szene::klebungen_setzen` applies it and starts from the as-built compliance, so
repeating or removing zones cannot compound.

Limits of the term: the factor is one number for the pair, so layers of
*different* thickness get the parallel-axis share distributed in proportion to
`D` rather than to `D + E·t·c²`; the equal-layer case of `MATERIAL.md` is exact.
Deflections of very floppy pieces are not measurable in this model at useful
mesh sizes — a 40 mm cantilever shears instead of bending and responds to a 10×
stiffer bending constraint by 0.03 %, which is why the acceptance measures the
plate stiffness through bending energy at a prescribed curvature.

Model for the user interface: CLO help "New in…" (Glue Fill, Glue Brush).

## Stage 5 — Inspection output

This is the actual purpose, not the display:

| Output | Shows |
|---|---|
| Strain map | **done for the measure** (`dehnung`, #17): principal strains per face, engineering strain `λ − 1`, in two frames — against the rest shape the solver uses (pattern × `1 − r`) and against the pattern itself, `(1 + e)(1 − r) − 1`; per-piece table in `anziehen` (faces, rest area, min/median/p90/max, count above 10 %, pattern median), full map as `dehnung.csv` via `--dehnung <dir>`. Colouring and per-frame output still open. Bluse3 v2 after the run: median 0.87 %, 90 % 10.0 %, 942 of 9 435 faces above 10 % (sleeve and side panel), 0 % of the front and cup pieces above. Exact checks without data: a flat piece at 12 % reads exactly 12 %, rest area = pattern area × `(1 − r)²` to 1e-12 |
| Distance map | **done for the measure** (`abstand`, #15): signed distance cloth point → skin surface, outside positive, with the nearest skin point and its normal; per-piece table in `anziehen` (min/median/p90/max/count inside), full map as `abstand.csv` via `--abstand <dir>`. Colouring and per-frame output still open. Bluse3 v2 after the run: min +0.2 mm, median 2.4 mm, max 36.6 mm, 0 of 5 538 points inside the skin. Cross-check on the reference garment mesh: median 20.4 mm, min 4.3 mm, 0 inside, 88 718 points in 0.6 s |
| Seam position | **done for the measure** (`nahtlage`, #25): smallest distance of every seam to the six named body points - armpit, shoulder point, bust point, left and right - with pair index and share along the seam, per-seam table in `anziehen`, `--nahtlage <dir>` writes `nahtlage.csv`. Two landmarks were added to `Anordnung` for it, the armpit (`IndexSet.txt` rows 16/17, the lowest of the three armhole points and the only one in the torso segment) and the bust point (rows 18/19); both are checked against `symmetry_data.sym` and `range_list.rlist` like the existing pairs. The seam is the **polyline through the pair midpoints**, not the sampled points: on a 20 mm mesh a nearest-vertex search reads 1.6 mm too much, which is the size of the numbers this map reports. Exact checks without data: 50 mm off the seam end reads 50.000 mm; 30 mm beside the middle of a segment reads 30.000 mm while the nearest vertex says 31.6; a 10 mm shift reads 10 mm less; the share is 0 at the first pair, 1 at the last and matches the length share to 1e-9. Bluse3 v2 after the run: `ende.obj` byte-identical, and the seam closest to each body point is the seam that runs over it - armpit 5.0 / 5.3 mm (armhole seams N05L/N05R), shoulder point 17.1 / 10.9 mm (the same), bust point 16.5 / 12.3 mm (bust seams N08L/N08R). **The numbers are not zero and are not claimed to be**: the pattern shoulder point sits 17 mm from the body landmark and the side seam starts 22 mm from the armpit, which is the placement offset this map exists to show. Colouring and `klon3d-view` stay open |
| Stress map | **done for the measure and the display** (`spannung`, #23): principal membrane forces per face in N/m, `strain × the piece's stiffness`, with the piece's own 10 % line in the table and the count above it, `--spannung <dir>` writes `spannung.csv`, `--farben` writes `spannung.obj` on a fourth fixed scale (0–35 N/m). **The honest limit is in the module doc**: with one material the solver's linear membrane makes this the strain map with other axis labels, so the map earns its place through absolute units (35 N/m is the documented 10 % line of the reference latex) and through mixed stiffness per piece, which `anziehen` really builds (`material.mit_dicke` per piece). Exact checks without data: 12 % on the documented latex reads 41.79 N/m hand-computed; two pieces in **one** scene keep their own stiffness (348.27 against 696.55 N/m) at identical strain. Bluse3 v2 after the run: median 3.04 N/m, p90 34.78, max 3612.48 (one face at the known 1037 % outlier), 942 of 9 435 faces above the 10 % line — the same 942 as the strain map, the cross-check that both describe one state; `spannung.csv` reproduces `dehnung.csv` × E for all 9 435 faces within the CSV rounding, `ende.obj` byte-identical, colour matches the scale for 5 538 of 5 538 points (≤ 1 channel). Per-frame output and `klon3d-view` stay open |
| Comparison map | **done for the measure and the display** (`vergleich`, `vergleichskarte`, #21): distance of every vertex to the **surface** of the other mesh, both directions, per-group table, `--csv` per vertex, and `--farben <dir>` writes `a_zu_b.obj` / `b_zu_a.obj` with `v x y z r g b`. The scale starts at **2 mm, not 0**: on the one comparison where the noise floor could be measured (the same project, fabric changed only) the surface distance had a median of 2.14 mm, so anything at or below reads as the cold end "inside the noise, no statement". Coordinates are printed to four decimals and `o` comes out as `g` — names and faces survive, both normalisations are documented in the writer. Reference meshes: 88 718 points, median 2.141 mm forward / 2.173 back, p90 9.489, max 58.050, matching the values in this file; colour matches the scale recomputed from the CSV for 88 718 of 88 718 points, exactly. Drawing it in `klon3d-view` is stage 6, the per-run scatter triple stays a measurement question |

**Colored vertex attributes** — **done for the export** (`farbkarte`, #19): `anziehen --farben <dir>`
writes `dehnung.obj`, `spannung.obj` (#23) and `abstand.obj` with `v x y z r g b`, the same geometry
as `ende.obj`. The scale is fixed per measure (strain 0–20 %, stress 0–35 N/m, distance 0–30 mm) and
printed with the run, so a colour in a picture reads back as a number and does not mean something
different in the next run. A value that is not a number is grey, not red. On Bluse3 v2 the colour of
all 5 538 points matches the scale applied to the numbers recomputed from the CSVs (≤ 1 channel of
rounding). Still open: drawing a scene in `klon3d-view` — it is a 2D pattern browser and a 3D view
belongs to stage 6.

### Comparing two runs (model: drape-delta-demo)

The model is <https://github.com/ZHOUCHENHAO1221/drape-delta-demo> (MIT,
as of 2026-10-18; local clone in `downloads/drape-delta-demo`). There, the same
garment is simulated twice in CLO, once with a
library fabric and once with a measured fabric, and compared point by
point. The method is adopted, not code or data: the
repository contains only the website, no latex fabric and no
raw measurements.

| Point | Decision for klon3d |
|---|---|
| Metric | mean point distance **and median**; the mean alone is skewed by individual outliers (there 24.5 mm mean against 12.0 mm median) |
| Display | distance per point as a color map on the garment, plus the largest single value |
| Different meshes | klon3d and CLO have different meshes: distance to the nearest point of the other surface, in both directions; not by matching point numbers |
| Scatter | CLO varies from run to run by about **10 mm per point** (particle distance 10). Differences below that do not count as a deviation. Compute each side three times and put each side's own scatter next to the difference |
| Garment | a difference only holds for the garment it was measured on; report draping and fitted garments separately |
| Interpretation | a difference says that two runs disagree, not which one is closer to reality |

Important for latex: with elastic fabrics, a difference in
**stretch** persists even on the fitted garment (jersey there: 95 mm draping,
49 mm fitted). Differences in **bending** shrink to
16–36% when fitted. For tight latex pieces, compare the stretch value first. First
use case: the same piece with `Latex_0.4mm_Radical_Rubber` and with the
Retifist preset `NR-sheet-0.40` (stretch 10× softer, see
`MATERIAL.md`).

## Stage 6 — User interface

`wgpu` + `egui`. No Qt — the Rust bindings are thin, Qt 4 is end-of-life.
Operation: load pattern, choose body, choose material, simulate. The
solver runs on the same `wgpu` device (ADR-018); meshes can be drawn without a detour
through the CPU.

**Requirements from the user (2026-10-20):** a **dark design**, **menus** and
**buttons**.

| Part | Content |
|---|---|
| Design | dark by default (egui `Visuals::dark`), switchable to light, the choice is saved; colors of the inspection maps (strain, distance) readable on a dark background |
| Menu bar | **File** (open pattern, measurement file, seam list, body, export OBJ/DXF, quit) · **Simulation** (start, pause, single step, reset, material) · **View** (2D pattern, 3D, mesh, seams, strain and distance map) · **Check** (seam lengths, mesh check) · **Help** |
| Toolbar | buttons for the most frequent commands: open, simulate/pause, reset, 2D/3D, choose map; with keyboard shortcuts |
| Side panels | piece list with seams and deviations (from `klon3d naehte`), properties of the selected piece (material, reduction) |
| Status bar | frames per second, GPU, largest seam deviation, messages |

Today's viewer `klon3d-fenster` (Win32 + GDI, finding 15) remains a
diagnostic tool; the application becomes a crate of its own (`klon3d-app`, `eframe`
with `wgpu`).

## Stage 7 — Motion

New since 2026-10-20 (ADR-018): the garment should also be checked in motion
— how it pulls when the arm is raised, where it slips.

| Part | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Body with skeleton | joints and skin weights for the body from stage 2, deformation via skinning (linear or dual quaternion). Source open: CLO avatar data (`.pos`/`.iks`/`.map`, finding 53; binding via triangles as in `.acc`, finding 69) or our own rigging | open |
| Motion data | read CLO's `.mtn` (joint sets with one 4×4 matrix per frame, finding 69); plus simple poses of our own (raise arm, take a step, twist torso) | format read (finding 69), open |
| Contact with a moving body | body velocity in friction and collision, small substeps or continuous collision detection so that nothing slips through the arm; check the artificial damping of backward Euler (ADR-020); latex fits tightly, this is where usefulness is decided | open; for a body at rest or rigidly moved the penetration check already exists (finding 94), for deforming triangles it does not |
| Self-collision | point–triangle and edge–edge handled separately (like CLO, finding 43), spatial hashing on the GPU | built on the CPU (finding 116: `selbstkollision.rs`, `anziehen --selbstkollision`, off by default); without layers/sub-layers; GPU open |
| Output | frame sequence (OBJ per frame, later glTF), strain and distance map per frame (stage 5) | open |

**Acceptance criterion (proposal, to be agreed with the user):** raise the arm of
test blouse v26 to 90° within one second: no penetration over 1 mm,
the seams hold, the pull at sleeve cap and armpit shows up the way the user
describes it on the real test garment; computation in real time or faster.

---

## Test case: test blouse v26

The simulation is only useful once it shows these five faults:

1. Plunge edges slide to the side, the bust falls out
2. Sleeve cap stands off ~3 cm at the top
3. Tension at the shoulder blade
4. Sleeve too tight along its whole length (reduction 4.4% / 2.2%)
5. Collar stands open at the front

Known beforehand: armhole 41.53 cm against body 41 — does not fit; according to
the *Catsuit* book (pp. 310/312), ~38.7 cm would be right.

**If the simulation cannot do this, it is useless as a check.** That is
how the handover document states it, and it still holds.

---

## Fabric alongside latex (ADR-021)

The user's request of 2026-10-27: klon3d should also work for real fabric,
with fabric patterns from Seamly2D. What that requires beyond latex,
per stage:

| Stage | needed for fabric | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Pattern reading | grainline per piece: read Seamly2D `<grainline>` (position, rotation), otherwise a fixed piece axis | open; the reader skips `<grainline>` |
| 3 Mesh | carry the grainline into the mesh (direction per triangle); sewn seam with the seam allowance turned inward instead of an overlap seam; glue zone = fusible interfacing | open |
| 4 Solver | **anisotropic material**: warp, weft and shear separate; for this a **triangle continuum** instead of edge springs (those have ν = 1/3 and no independent shear); noticeable, direction-dependent bending; **self-collision** and layers, because fabric falls into folds | open; edge springs isotropic; self-collision since finding 116 (switch, CPU), layers missing |
| Material | `.zfab` reader in Rust, values from CLO's fabric library (ADR-015), no measurements of our own | open; only the Python reader |
| 5 Inspection output | drape and folds; comparison against CLO with the same fabric, draping and fitted reported separately (already specified) | open |

**Acceptance case for fabric:** a fabric pattern from Seamly2D chosen by the user,
with a CLO fabric from the library, compared standing against CLO
as described in stage 5. The criterion is to be agreed with her.

---

## Reading CLO projects (ADR-022)

The user's request of 2026-10-27: CLO projects should be compatible.
Test material: 47 `.zprj` in `downloads/clo3d-patterns` (third-party files, used only
as data), plus our own test projects from CLO in which the same pattern
also exists as `.sm2d`. Format knowledge comes from the findings, `spez/`
and `work/` (ADR-024).

| Step | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Container | header and ZIP block (findings 10, 50, 51), property tree (finding 57) read in Rust | **done** — `zip.rs` (own reader, preamble of 436,425 B in `.zprj`) and `property.rs`; 2034/2034 arrays with `u32 n + u8 type` (finding 117) |
| Pieces | `mapShape2D` of the blocks (finding 62) → seam line, internal lines, grainline, unit; from this the mesh, as for `.sm2d` | **read** — 31 pieces, 194 boundary lines, 107 internal shapes with 131 lines; unit mm confirmed; the mesh is still built by klon3d itself |
| Seams | `listSeamLinePairGroup` → seam list (edge, direction, sections) instead of `.naehte` | **done** — 143 pairs / 286 sides, `uiDepth` 1 = boundary (240), 2 = internal line (46), `arrMeshPointIndex` local; 0 broken sides |
| Placement | `mapArrange` and `.pos` → placement data instead of `.lage`, on klon3d's hull bodies (new zones for legs) | **`mapArrange` read** (finding 118): `qsPanName`/`fNormalizedHeight`/`fNormalizedArcLength`/`fAngle` per piece, but a zone only for 9 of 31 pieces; `.pos` carries **only the avatar pose**, not the piece placement. Mapping onto the hull bodies open |
| 3D mesh | read `baPosition3D` (CLO's simulated mesh) and `baRest` (rest shape), output as OBJ — comparison reference for stage 5 | **done** — 12 B/vertex (3 × f32, mm), 88,718 vertices / 169,181 triangles, 0 deviation from the 2D data; `--obj` writes 31 objects, 47/47 third-party projects; seams meet only with `bDraped=1` + `bActive` (mean 0.171 mm) (finding 118) |
| Comparison baseline | How much does CLO itself scatter? The same pattern with a different fabric as a calibration value | **done** - `backup` state bit-identical to the download, identical topology. Two measures: displacement by index **median 6.10 mm**, 90% 20.55, 99% 41.46, max 68.92; distance to the **surface** (the measure for klon3d) **median 2.14 mm**, 90% 9.49, max 58.05. The difference is sliding along the surface. `klon3d vergleich <a.obj> <b.obj>` computes it in Rust (finding 118, section 11) |
| Fabric | fabric per piece from the project, values as in `.zfab` (ADR-015, ADR-021) | **done** — `mapFabricShape2D.iFabricIndex` per piece, `mapPhysical` with thickness/density/profile; 6/18/2/5 = 31 |
| Avatar | avatar or measurements of the project, otherwise the user's `.smis` | **body done** (finding 119): `body` from the `.avt` (ZIP inside the CLO header, containing a `.dan` without header, `listSkinController`), **31,422 vertices / 62,658 triangles**, mm in avatar space (y = height, the same space as the garment); `--koerper-obj` writes it, **40 of 47** third-party projects have an `.avt`. **Segment and landmark mapping done** (finding 120): `anordnung_clo.rs` applies CLO's `range_list.rlist` + `IndexSet.txt` — confirmed via edges 98.56%, neighborhoods 92.2%, displacement 0.70 mm against 629.86 mm for a random permutation; the 2020 L52 is wrong (8.91 mm), the check rejects it. Measurements from the `.avt` (resizing) still open |

Acceptance of the reader: `klon3d zprj <project.zprj> [--teile] [--naehte] [--stoffe] [--netz] [--obj <file>]`
against `work/messung/japanese_school_uniform` (0 broken seam sides, exit code 0) and
against the **47 third-party `.zprj`** in `downloads/clo3d-patterns`: 47/47 read,
2,109 pieces, 4,256 seam pairs, 0 errors (finding 117, sections 7 and 8).

Acceptance of the 3D mesh (finding 118): 88,718 vertices / 169,181 triangles, 0 deviation from the 2D data;
`--obj` writes 31 objects with 0 degenerate triangles, 47/47 third-party projects with a mesh (0 errors).
Reference for the comparison: `work/messung/japanese_school_uniform/clo3d_netz.obj`.
Touchstone for every seam measurement: only `bDraped=1` (group) **and** `bActive` (pair) is the sewn
state — mean 0.171 mm against 21.2 / 44.2 mm otherwise.

Acceptance of the body (finding 119): `klon3d zprj <project.zprj> --koerper-obj <file.obj>` writes `body`
with 31,422 vertices / 62,658 triangles (0 triangle indices out of range), 40/47 third-party projects with a body, 7 without
an `.avt` (not a read error). Cross-check against an independent Python parser: largest deviation 0.00005 mm
(OBJ rounding only).

**The body is usable without re-posing** (finding 119, 4.1/4.2): it stands in an A-pose with the arms **22° from the
vertical** (not horizontal) — and that **is** the pose CLO computed in, because the sleeve sits on
the arm (98–99% of the nearest body points lie on the arm themselves). Nothing is inside the body (0/1,117 left sleeve,
0/1,198 right, 0/65,339 skirt, 0/16,082 torso). Garment→skin per group: sleeves 14.0/14.5, back torso 7.7, front 24.7, skirt
24.5 mm; nowhere below 4.4 mm. The `.pos` is only needed for a **different** pose (fitting).

Acceptance of the distance map (stage 5, `crates/klon3d-sim/src/abstand.rs`, #15): `klon3d anziehen
<pattern.sm2d> --abstand <dir>` prints a per-piece table (points, min, median, p90, max, points inside) and writes
`abstand.csv` (point, piece, position in cm, signed distance in mm, skin normal). The same measure reproduces the
unsigned comparison exactly on the reference garment: median 20.4 mm, p90 60.2, p99 90.7, max 106.0 mm for 88,718
points in 0.6 s, min 4.3 mm against finding 119's 4.4. Sign is checked against ray parity on the real body across the
clothing band (z 0.5–1.45 m, 160 samples, 0 deviations); outside that band the pseudo-normal is unreliable by known
cases at nose, lip and toes — the test enforces that those deviations exist rather than hiding them.
Bluse3 v2: 0 of 5,538 points inside the skin, min +0.2 mm, median 2.4 mm, max 36.6 mm.

**What that cross-check does not cover** (finding 118, section 11): it measures CLO's garment mesh against CLO's body,
not a klon3d run against it — for the reference project there is only the `.zprj` and no `.sm2d` + `.naehte` + `.lage`,
and the axes need rotating (CLO y = height, klon3d z = height). The **body** was never the blocker
(finding 119), and **neither is its segment and landmark mapping** (finding 120):
`klon3d anziehen <pattern.sm2d> --zprj <project.zprj>` takes `body` from the `.avt`, plus segments from
`range_list.rlist` and landmarks from `IndexSet.txt`. CLO's numbering applies unchanged — confirmed via edges
(98.56%), neighborhoods (92.2%) and the smoothness of the displacement (0.70 mm against 629.86 mm for a random permutation).
First run with bustier v1: 298 of 299 seam pairs within 10 mm. **The comparison baseline, however, already exists:**
the `backup` state is
bit-identical to the download (same topology, `baRest`/`baTri` identical in 31/31 pieces). CLO's own
result shifts from the fabric change alone

- **by index** (same vertex, only possible with identical topology) by **median 6.10 mm**
  (90% 20.55 / 99% 41.46 / max 68.92),
- in **distance to the surface** - the measure that applies to klon3d against CLO - by **median 2.14 mm**
  (90% 9.49 / max 58.05).

The difference is tangential sliding; below **2 mm surface distance** a difference cannot be told apart from
CLO's own variation. Tool: `klon3d vergleich <a.obj> <b.obj> [--zelle mm] [--csv file]`.

Writing back as `.zprj` has not been decided; the route to CLO remains
`klon3d dxf`.

Stages 1 and 2 are independent and can be done in parallel. Stage 4 depends on both.
Stage 7 needs 4b (GPU) and 4d as well as a body with a skeleton.

## Honest assessment

This is a **multi-month project**, not a one-week project. Realistically:

| Stage | Size |
|---|---|
| 1 Pattern reading | the most laborious single stage, but a finite set |
| 2 Body | small, a template exists |
| 3 Mesh | medium, standard methods |
| 4 Solver | second most laborious, the core; with the GPU version and placement larger than originally thought |
| 5 Output | small |
| 6 User interface | medium |
| 7 Motion | large: skeleton and skin weights, contact with a moving body, self-collision |

The work proceeds stage by stage and shows confirmed results after each stage, instead of
delivering something untested at the end. The solver is first checked against the
simple "tube" case, which the existing stage 2 has already solved
— this shows whether the physics holds before a sleeve depends on it.

Still open is the calibration of the latex material: the numbers in the
handover are marked as an assumption, and there are no calibrated values for
latex with reduction on the skin. That is the biggest uncertainty in the
entire simulation.
