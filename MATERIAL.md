# Material model — CLO-compatible

Principle: **CLO's fabric parametrization is adopted, not replaced.**
Same field names, same meaning, same units. For latex the values are set
isotropically (Warp = Weft = Bias).

Rationale: only then can values from `.zfab` files and from CLO's Property Editor
be transferred directly, and only then is a solver result comparable with CLO.

**Status 2026-10-19:** the basis is now a **measured** latex profile
(CLO Fabric Kit, Radical Rubber 0.4 mm) instead of the table of expected values from
2026-10-18. Derivation, file format and comparisons: `../latex-stoffe/` (not part of this repository).
Nothing is used in the solver yet; stage 4 is not built.

## Sources of the values

| Source | File |
|---|---|
| **Measured latex profile** | [`assets/stoffe/Latex_0.4mm_Radical_Rubber.zfab`](assets/stoffe/) |
| Thicknesses and laminates computed from it | `assets/stoffe/Latex_*_abgeleitet.zfab` (*abgeleitet* = derived) |
| Derivation, value tables, tool | `../latex-stoffe/` (not part of this repository) |
| Structure of `.zfab` and of the property tree | `../latex-stoffe/FORMAT.md` (not part of this repository) |
| Table of expected values (estimate from 2026-10-18) | [`assets/LATEX_MATERIALPROFIL.md`](assets/LATEX_MATERIALPROFIL.md) |
| CLO parameter structure | finding 09 |

Origin of the profile: project `2022_racing_miku_v2` from
<https://github.com/tabjy/clo3d-patterns> (CC BY-SA 4.0, tabjy). Across all 47
projects of this collection it is the only real latex profile.

## The CLO fields and their latex values

Values of the measured profile at 0.4 mm. Field names in the file as described in
`../latex-stoffe/FORMAT.md`; units as in CLO's Property Editor.

| CLO field | in the file | Unit | Latex 0.4 mm | scales with | Note |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Stretch-Weft / -Warp | `fSuK` / `fSvK` | g/s² | 348,274 | t | direction-independent |
| Shear | `fHK` | g/s² | 174,159 | t | = Stretch / 2, see below |
| Bending-Weft / -Warp / -Bias | `fBuK` / `fBvK` / `fBhK` | g·mm²/s²/rad | 2,482 | t³ | the same in all directions |
| Buckling Ratio / Stiffness | `fBuLR` …, `fBucklingStiffness…` | 0–1 | 0 / 0 | – | no threads, no buckling |
| Density | `fDensity` | g/m² | 349 | t | corresponds to 0.87 g/cm³ |
| Thickness | `fThickness` | mm | 0.4 | t | also the collision thickness |
| Friction | `fFriction` | – | 0.03 | – | CLO default, **not a measured value**; latex grips more |
| Internal Damping | `fIDS` | – | 0.0001 | – | CLO displays 1 |
| Nonlinear | `listNonlinearSuK` … | factors | all 1.0 | – | CLO computes the profile **linearly** |

Shrinkage is not a property of the fabric but of the pattern piece; the
reduction is built into the pattern.

## Measured tensile values

Raw data of the Fabric Kit (`mapRawData`), identical in all three directions.
The units are not stored in the file, presumably % and kgf:

| Length | 12.33 | 33.33 | 40.67 | 66.67 | 100 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Force | 0.100 | 0.230 | 0.300 | 0.470 | 0.595 |
| Force / length, relative to point 1 | 1.00 | 0.85 | 0.91 | 0.87 | 0.73 |

The material becomes about **27%** softer as it stretches, with some scatter.
The table of expected values from 2026-10-18 had 35% (E 1.08 → 0.70 MPa). CLO turned
this into one fixed value and left the curve flat; for a nonlinear model here,
the five points are the basis.

**Conversion to E (assumption, not verified):** CLO's unit g/s² is force per
width, 1 g/s² = 1 mN/m. Then Stretch = E · t:

```
K = 348,274 g/s² = 348 N/m        E = K / t = 348 N/m / 0.4 mm ≈ 0.87 MPa
```

That lies between the values of the expected-values table (1.08 / 0.84 / 0.70 MPa)
and within the range Retifist gives for soft natural rubber sheeting
(M300 ≈ 0.9–1.2 MPa).

### Shear stiffness

The measured profile has **Shear = Stretch / 2**. ADR-015 had assumed G = E/3 for the
membrane and derived "Shear ≈ Stretch" from it. How CLO's
Shear value relates to G is not settled; the measured value is what
counts.

### Bending stiffness

Measured: 2,482 g·mm²/s²/rad, raw overhang data 23.5 and 35 (presumably mm).
Cross-check with the plate formula D = E·t³ / (12·(1−ν²)), ν = 0.5, under
the same unit assumption: about 6,200 g·mm²/s²/rad. Measurement and formula are
thus in the same range (factor 2.5).

## Other thicknesses and laminates

Same compound assumed: stretch, shear and weight ∝ t, bending ∝ t³.
Laminates fully bonded, like a single sheet of the total thickness.

| File in `assets/stoffe/` | t mm | g/m² | Stretch g/s² | Shear g/s² | Bending |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `Latex_0.25mm_abgeleitet` | 0.25 | 218 | 217,671 | 108,849 | 606 |
| **`Latex_0.4mm_Radical_Rubber`** (measured) | 0.40 | 349 | 348,274 | 174,159 | 2,482 |
| `Latex_1.0mm_abgeleitet` | 1.00 | 872 | 870,685 | 435,398 | 38,785 |
| `Latex_Laminat_2x0.25mm_abgeleitet` | 0.50 | 436 | 435,343 | 217,699 | 4,848 |
| `Latex_Laminat_0.4+0.25mm_abgeleitet` | 0.65 | 567 | 565,946 | 283,008 | 10,651 |
| `Latex_Laminat_2x0.4mm_abgeleitet` | 0.80 | 698 | 696,548 | 348,318 | 19,858 |
| `Latex_Laminat_3x0.4mm_abgeleitet` | 1.20 | 1,047 | 1,044,822 | 522,477 | 67,021 |
| `Latex_Laminat_2x1.0mm_abgeleitet` | 2.00 | 1,745 | 1,741,371 | 870,795 | 310,280 |

The pattern files use 0.4 mm on the torso and 1.0 mm on cups and collar
(PLAN, stage 4); both are therefore available as files.

## Compliance for XPBD

XPBD does not work with a stiffness `k` but with a **compliance**
`α = 1/k`. With the membrane stiffness K (Stretch in N/m, assumption above), an
edge of length L that represents a strip of width w has:

```
k = K · w / L        →        α = L / (K · w)
```

For 10 mm edge length and 50 mm strip width:

| Thickness | K | k | α |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.25 mm | 218 N/m | 1,088 N/m | 9.2·10⁻⁴ m/N |
| 0.40 mm | 348 N/m | 1,741 N/m | 5.7·10⁻⁴ m/N |
| 1.00 mm | 871 N/m | 4,353 N/m | 2.3·10⁻⁴ m/N |

The earlier estimate for 0.4 mm was 1,400–2,160 N/m; the measured
value lies in between.

These are very soft constraints — exactly as intended. Set too soft, however,
the garment slides **to the floor**, as reported in the CLO forum:

> "Why the fabric in the forum slid to the floor: Stretch was set far too
> soft."

**This is a validation criterion, not a detail:** the solver must let an
insufficiently held piece be pulled down. If it does not, the
stiffness is miscalibrated.

## Reference fabrics

`assets/stoffe/` contains eight fabric files in CLO's `.zfab` format.

All eight are **latex** (format 7 like CLO's library, black, material type
Plastic). Loaded in CLO (earlier version) on 2026-10-19 and checked in the
Property Editor:
the original, 0.25 mm, 1.0 mm, laminates 2×0.25, 0.4+0.25 and
2×0.4. The laminates 3×0.4 and 2×1.0 have not been opened in CLO.

The Retifist presets `NR-sheet-*.zfab` are not included: their values are set, not
measured, and at 0.4 mm they are about 10× softer in stretch and 40× softer in
bending; moreover, Retifist releases the `.zfab` files only for use at one's own
workstation. Comparison in `../latex-stoffe/LIESMICH.md`.

**Purpose:** simulate the same fabrics in CLO and compute them in klon3d's own
solver. If stretch, drape and distance to the skin agree, the
material model is confirmed.

## Open issues, stated plainly

- **Only 0.4 mm is measured.** All other thicknesses and the laminates are
  computed and assume the same compound (Radical Rubber). Measurements of our
  own are not possible; they are judged by plausibility.
- **The unit assumption** (g/s² = force per width) behind E ≈ 0.87 MPa and
  behind the compliance table is not confirmed.
- **No friction value.** 0.03 is CLO's default. For the question under test (does the
  sleeve cap stand off?) it is exactly the decisive parameter — see
  `PARITY.md`, row "Tack spring for stickiness".
- **Curve:** five sample points with scatter, units not stored in the file.
- The fabric files are **not yet used in the solver**; a `.zfab` reader
  so far exists only as a Python tool (`../latex-stoffe/werkzeug/zprj_stoffe.py`).
